# SpeechEnhancers
Code to train and test FullSubNet and Wave-U-Net speech enhancement architectures on denoising/noise reduction. For FullSubNet, there exists a modification for AEC (+ training/data augmentation process for leakage removal in a musical choir singing context).

The implementations are based on [haoxiangsnr's](https://github.com/haoxiangsnr) work and were developed mainly for my [thesis project](https://github.com/wimmerb/singing-quality-enhancement).
